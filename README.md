👋 Hi, I’m Max (@Maxime-Murphy)

❤️‍🔥 I like to analyse data, develop tools related to data science and learn new things in general!. 

I built a python library and a data browser to easily access all datasets of the Bulk Data Download Service (BDDS) of UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). 

I’m also interested in developing stock picking ML model based on great fundamental investors' strategies like Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.
I am currently developping the code for consuming the FinHub api and wrangle the large amount of data to create a clean SQL database.

👀 I'm looking for collaborators to help me with my stock picking project  :  
    ==> Create ETL pipeline to automate the consumption/data wrangling/analysis  
    ==> Implement the best ML strategy for predicting time-series and signal buy/sell based on fundamental stock analysis
    
    This project could be turned into a valuable app...
