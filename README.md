- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxime-Murphy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a fundamental stock picking ML model based on fundamental metrics (think long-term investment approach of stockpicking legends such as : Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.) and apply back-testing methods to validate the results. 
- My other projects are related to developping tools to streamline data access (python, streamlit)
***
NOTE: I just started using gitHub and will publish my work when I have time, but for now this is just an intro to my interests... 
***
:eye_speech_bubble: I'm looking for collaborators to joint my stock picking project : 
- ==> You might know the best ML strategy for predicting time-series/back-testing :))
- ==> Maybe you have lots of experience creating scalable SQL databases, then I surely would appreciate your input!
