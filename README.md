👋 Hi, I’m @Maxime-Murphy  
❤️‍🔥 I’m interested in developing a stock picking ML model based on fundamental metrics (think long-term investment approach of stockpicking legends such as :    Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.) and apply back-testing methods to validate the results.  
   My other projects are related to developping tools to streamline data access (python, streamlit)
***
NOTE: I just started using gitHub and will publish my work when I have time, but for now this is just an intro to my interests... 
***
👀 I'm looking for collaborators to join my stock picking project  : 
    ==> You might know the best ML strategy for predicting time-series/back-testing :))
    ==> Maybe you have lots of experience creating scalable SQL databases, then I surely would appreciate your input!
    
    This project could be turned into an app, but in the meantime it's really for fun and personal use!
