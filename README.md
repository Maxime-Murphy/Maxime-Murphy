👋 Hi, I’m Max (@Maxime-Murphy)

❤️‍🔥 I like to analyse data, develop tools related to data science and learn new things in general!. 
E.g. I built a python library and a databrowser to easily access all of UNESCO-UIS datasets. 

I’m also interested in developing stock picking ML model based on great fundamental investors' strategy like Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.
I am currently developping the code for consuming the FinHub api and wrangle the large amount of data to create a clean SQL database.
   
In general I like to work on projects that cover both my interests and my professional goals to become a better data scientist and developper.

***
NOTE: I just started using gitHub and will publish my work when I have time, but for now this is just an intro to my interests... 
***
👀 I'm looking for collaborators to join my stock picking project  :  
    ==> Create ETL pipeline to automate the consumption/data wrangling/analysis  
    ==> Implement the best ML strategy for predicting time-series and signal buy/sell based on fundamental stock analysis
    
    This project could be turned into an app, but in the meantime it's really for fun and personal use!
