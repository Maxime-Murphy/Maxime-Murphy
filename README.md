- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxime-Murphy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a fundamental stock picking ML model based on fundamental metrics (think long-term investment approach of stockpicking legends such as : Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.) and apply back-testing methods to validate the results. 
- My other projects are related to developping tools to streamline data access
- NOTE: I just started using gitHub and will publish my work when I have time, but for now this is just an intro to my interests... 
- 💞️ If you would like to collaborate on my stock picker, feel free to reach out! You might know the best ML strategy for predicting time-series/back-testing :)), or maybe you have a lot of experience creating scalable SQL database, then I surely would appreciate your input!
