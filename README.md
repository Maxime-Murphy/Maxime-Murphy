- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxime-Murphy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a fundamental stock picking ML model based on fundamental metrics (think long-term investment approach of stockpicking legends such as : Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.) and apply back-testing methods to validate the results. 
- My other projects are related developping tool to streamline data access (a library and data browser for connecting to UNESCO-UIS data)
- 💞️ If stock analysis is an interest, you know how to apply Machine learning to time-series and make prediction/projections, or maybe you have experience with back-testing, I would love to hear from you. The project so far is a pipeline calling the data from an the finnHub API, consolidating the data, computing new metrics, and exporting to Excel with conditional formatting for visual picking. I'm now working on a more permanent solution for storage using a postgreSQL database. Next steps will be to develop the predictive models, then apply back-testing methods on time series. I'm using Python...
