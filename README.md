- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxime-Murphy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a fundamental stock picking model based on fundamental metrics (think long-term investment approach of stockpicking legend such as : Graham, Buffet, Lynch, etc.) and apply back-testing methods to validate the models. 
- 💞️ If stock analysis is an interest, you know how to apply Machine learning to time-series and make prediction/projections, or maybe you have experience with back-testing, I would love to hear from you. I'm also open to social science research with a data science component.
